#Project summary
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children aged 1-14.9 years, with an incidence of approximately 3.5 cases pr. 100.000 children in Europe and the U.S. Survival rates have increased to 85% after first line treatment, but many patients are burdened by life-long toxicities. Asparaginase (ASP) is one of the most important antileukemic drugs. Studies have shown that patients receiving prolonged administration of this drug have a superior survival rate, compared to patients who have their therapy trunctated due to toxicity1. ASP, however, is associated with several toxicities, pancreatitis being one of the most common2â€“5. Asparaginase-associated Pancreatitis (AAP) has an incidence of 6.8%6 in the current NOPHO ALL2008 protocol and is among the most common reasons for truncating ASP treatment. However, risk factors, including genetic predisposition to AAP, are not well known.
This study provides deep phenotyping of 633 AAP patients based on data from more 19 large international childhood ALL groups. Furthermore we will explore the host genome variants associated with developing AAP. The latter is examined in more than 230 children who developed AAP while in childhood ALL therapy The retrospective AAP phenotype study is the first of its kind in collecting data on a specific toxicity from multiple international childhood ALL groups, i.e. across many treatment protocols. This will provide sufficient power in describing in detail the phenotype of AAP. 633 case reports have been collected and analysed. This large dataset will allow exploration of risk factors, long term outcome including risk of chronic pancreatitis, and establish guidelines for ASP re-exposure after an episode of AAP.

The Genome Wide Association (GWA) Study investigates ~2.500.000 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms(SNPs) spread across the genome with emphasis on the exome. We will link individual SNPs as well as biological pathways to the risk of developing AAP. Cases from the phenotype study will be compared to international controls. DNA on 230 cases and >1500 controls have been collected. The study will provide new insights into genes related to developing AAP, and validate genes found in previous GWA studies on AAP6,7.
This study will provide new knowledge on AAP, and thereby improve treatment of childhood ALL in patients in high risk of AAP.
